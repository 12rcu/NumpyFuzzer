# NumPy Fuzzer 
These are other solution approaches for the value pool and the grammar fuzzer

## Value Pool Fuzzer
Value pool fuzzer with type selection
It can be selected if successful tests are printed or not.

## Grammar Fuzzer
Grammar Fuzzer, with a grammar for the NumPy ufuncs. 
It is an experimental grammar approach, because it uses randomizers to represent the infinite amount of number possibilites.
It can be selected if successful tests are printed or not.
